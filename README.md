# 🔥 ESP32 Firebase Realtime Monitoring and Control

This project uses an **ESP32** microcontroller to monitor an **LDR (light sensor)** and control **LEDs** through a **Firebase Realtime Database**, with a simple **web interface** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time **LDR value and voltage** logging to Firebase
- 💡 Control **LEDs remotely** (digital on/off and analog brightness)
- 📶 ESP32 **presence detection**: shows online/offline status on the web app
- 🌐 Clean Firebase-integrated web dashboard
- 🔒 Secure with Firebase Database Rules

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **ESP32** (Arduino/C++)
- **Firebase Realtime Database**
- **HTML + CSS + JS** frontend (uses Firebase Web SDK)
- **WiFi (ESP32 as client)**

---

## 🔌 Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Dev Board  
- 1x LDR + Resistor (for voltage divider)
- 2x LEDs (for digital and PWM control)
- Jumper wires, breadboard, power
